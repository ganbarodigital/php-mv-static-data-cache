# Introduction

## What Is The Static Data Cache Library?

Ganbaro Digital's _Static Data Cache Library_ provides an incredibly simple key/value data cache that you can quickly drop into your own project to save you time and effort.

## Goals

The _Static Data Cache Library_'s purpose is to provide caches to speed up expensive operations.

## Design Constraints

The library's design is guided by the following constraint(s):

* _Fundamental development dependency of other libraries_: This library provides code for other libraries to use internally. Composer does not support multual dependencies (two or more packages depending on each other). As a result, this library needs to depend on very little (if anything at all).
